# Minecraft_Mod
 
Hello there! My name is Daniel, and I have begun to test my skills by Modding Minecraft!

The two mods that I am currently working on are as follows:

Mod 1: Lemons 4 me.
I am adding Lemons, as well as a variety of other lemon based things (blocks of lemons, lemon weapons and armor, etc.). This is my first mod and as such I am using it to get used to the process of making mods

Mod 2: Musicians B Crazy.
This mod will be adding in all sorts of Musical Instruments, such as Trumpets, Guitars, Clarinets, Drums, and many more!!!
